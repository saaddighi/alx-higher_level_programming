# Test Case 1: Regular division
>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
>>> divisor = 2
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, divisor)
[[0.5, 1.0, 1.5], [2.0, 2.5, 3.0], [3.5, 4.0, 4.5]]

# Test Case 2: Division with a different matrix
>>> matrix = [[10, 20, 30], [40, 50, 60], [70, 80, 90]]
>>> divisor = 10
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, divisor)
[[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0, 9.0]]

# Test Case 3: Division with a floating-point divisor
>>> matrix = [[3, 6, 9], [12, 15, 18], [21, 24, 27]]
>>> divisor = 3.0
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, divisor)
[[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0, 9.0]]

# Test Case 4: Division by zero
>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
>>> divisor = 0
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, divisor)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

# Test Case 5: Invalid matrix (not a list of lists)
>>> matrix = [1, 2, 3]
>>> divisor = 2
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, divisor)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats
